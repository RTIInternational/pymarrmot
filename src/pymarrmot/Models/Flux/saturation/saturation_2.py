def saturation_2(S, Smax, p1, In):
    # Flux function
    # Description: Saturation excess from a store with different degrees of saturation
    # Constraints: 1-S/Smax >= 0 prevents numerical issues with complex numbers

    # Inputs:
    #   S - current storage [mm]
    #   Smax - maximum contributing storage [mm]
    #   p1 - non-linear scaling parameter [-]
    #   In - incoming flux [mm/d]

    # NOTE: When stores are very slightly below or over their maximum, the exponent can push this function into regions where no feasible solutions exist.
    # The min(max()) combination prevents this from happening.
